# Functions required:
# Multiply
# Integer Divide with remainder
# Convert b10 to bX
# Convert bX to b10

# Algorithm MAIN:
# 1) Input n, a, b
# 2) Input n, a into bX to b10
# 3) Input result, b into b10 to bX
# 4) Output result

# Algorithm MULT
# 1) Add value to running total
# 2) Repeat until count exceeds second value
# 3) Output total

# Algorithm INT DIV W REMAIN
# 1) Repeatedly subtract by div and increment count
# 2) Repeat until integer - div < 0
# 3) Output count

# Algorithm B10 TO BX
# 1) Int divide by base**2, base and 1
# 2) Output a*100 + b*10 + c

# Algorithm BX TO B10
# 1) Int divide by 100, 10 and 1
# 2) Output a*base**2 + b*base + c
